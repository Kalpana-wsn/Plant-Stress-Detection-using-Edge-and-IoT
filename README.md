# ⭐Plant-Stress-Detection
Plant stress detection is crucial for farmers to ensure healthy crop growth and improved yield. In this work, we have developed a Plant Stress Detection system using Deep Learning. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to classify leaf images into multiple stress categories. The model is implemented using the PyTorch framework and trained on the PlantVillage dataset.


## ⭐Testing Images

* If you do not have leaf images then you can use test images located in test_images folder
* Each image has its corresponding disease name, so you can verify whether the model is working perfectly or not
